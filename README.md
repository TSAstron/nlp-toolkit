Various tools for text scraping, processing, analysis, machine learning and other linguistic/textual purposes.

# extractors

Tools for extraction of text. Examples include scraping the web for Lovecraft's stories, or processing a txt compilation of Aseop's Fables.

# processors

Preparing the specific text for application. E.g. splitting stories into chunks, encoding/embedding the chenks for the purpose of similarity search, retrieval and possibly further generation.

# applicators

There are currently two bare-bones html/js implementations of RAG queries: for the Aseop Fables and for Lovecraft's stories.
A proper version can be found at https://rag.monodromy.group, and also includes automated image generation to illustrate the excerpts.
