Here there will be a greater variety of tools: from chunking texts, through obtaining and using tokenizers, to encoding and embedding.

Currently, there are tools for story related RAG. Two splitters - for Lovecraft and Aesop - and a common embedder with the MiniLML6-v2 model, using Xenova's version of Transformers.js.
The embedding script is for node.js, because the final useage will be in the browser through Javascript, so best to keep it compatible.
